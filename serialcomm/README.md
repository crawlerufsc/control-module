# Serial communication
A robust Serial Communication submodule for the control module<br />
<br />
This module enables communication between the control module running on the Raspberry Pi and a low level sensor/actuator controller running on the arduino
<br />
The idea here is to have a high degree of certainty whether the issued command was received and acknowledged or failed and should be repeated.
